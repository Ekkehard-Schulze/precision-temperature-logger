/ TMP117 sensor configuration
/ --------------------------------------
/ up to four TMP117 can be used on the I2C-bus
/ each sensor must be configured (wired) for its own individual I2C bus address
/ four different addresses are availabe: 0x48, 0x49, 0x4A, and 0x4B
/ these generate column names TMP1, TMP2, TMP3, TMP4

/ charging
/----------
/ Charge logger using a Mico-USB cable with  switch in ON position. 
/ Remove micro-SD card, if you do not want to log data during charging.
/ The yellow LED indicates charging activity. It goes dark when charging finished.
/ Charge current is 400 mA, maximal required charge time is 8 hours
/ 
/ Attention: 400 mA charge current is NOT the default charge current 
/ of the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger #2795 board!
/ 
/ you have to change R0 to 2k2 (resistor package SMD 0805) to set 
/ 400 mA charge current
