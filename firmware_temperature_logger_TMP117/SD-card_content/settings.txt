/ This config file is for the TMP117 Adafruit Feather 32u4 Adalogger
/ This file requires UNIX line ends (LF). 
/ The first character of this line ('/') specifies a line as a comment.
/ A comment does not influence the logger.

/ TMP117 sensor configuration
/ --------------------------------------
/ up to four TMP117 can be used on the I2C-bus
/ each sensor must be configured (wired) for its own individual I2C bus address
/ four different addresses are availabe: 0x48, 0x49, 0x4A, and 0x4B
/ these generate column names TMP1, TMP2, TMP3, TMP4

/ charging
/----------
/ charge logger using a Mico-USB cable with  switch in ON position. 
/ Remove microSD card, if you do not want to log data during charging.
/ the yellow LED indicates charging activity. It goes dark when charging finished.
/ charge current is 400 mA, max. charge time is 7 hours
/ charge current is programmed on the Feather Logger with a resistor, 500 mA is NOT the native charge current
/ you have to change R0 to 2k2 (resistor package SMD 0805)
